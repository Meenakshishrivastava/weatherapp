# WeatherApp
# Description
Hey everyone. Welcome to our project. In this project, we created a weather app. To build this app we needed HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The project consists of a search bar. The user enters the desired city into the input field and clicks on the search button. On hitting the search button we first verify if such a city exists in the database. If no, we display an error message saying – “No city found.

In this project, we created a weather app in which we need to use a weather API to fetch data for a specific location. There are many weather APIs available online, some of which are free to use. One popular option is the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides real-time weather data for locations worldwide and in this project i used API from this application for free.

After selecting an API, we used JavaScript to make an API request and retrieve the relevant weather data. then used HTML and CSS to display the data on a webpage. We start by creating a simple layout for our app, with a header, main content area, and footer. And also include input fields for the user to enter their location.

Once we have retrieved the weather data, we can display the current temperature, weather condition, and other relevant information on the webpage. we also added some basic styling to make the app look visually appealing. For example, we used icons to represent the weather condition, and use different colors or fonts to highlight important information.

To make this app more dynamic, we added additional features such as a search function, location detection, or the ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Overall, building a weather app can be a fun and rewarding project for beginners and experienced developers alike. With the right tools and resources, we created a useful and visually appealing app that provides real-time weather data for locations worldwide
